# Wage_Formation_App

Wages and salaries are a basic concept used in every sector of the economy, so the idea of wage management and wage formation can be considered leading. The plan is to create a database that analyses data about the organisation's employees, such as their salary, insurance benefits, taxes, bonuses and compensation. This requires some key data such as employee name, benefits, position, attendance (along with days off granted), payroll system, etc. Taking all these calculations into account, the database will suggest the optimum amount of pay.
